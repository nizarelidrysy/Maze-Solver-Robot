# DAMI 3000: An Advanced Arduino Robot

This repository contains the full code for DAMI 3000, a versatile Arduino-based robot designed to demonstrate several key robotics and embedded systems concepts. The robot features multiple operational modes, including Bluetooth control and autonomous maze navigation, all managed through a comprehensive user interface.

## üöÄ Features

* [cite_start]**Multi-Mode Operation**: Select from four distinct operational modes using a 4x4 keypad[cite: 401, 402, 403]:
    * [cite_start]**Bluetooth Mode (1)**: Remotely control the robot's movement (forward, backward, left, right) and other functions (servo, buzzer) via a Bluetooth connection[cite: 455, 468, 565, 566, 567, 568, 569, 570, 571, 572, 573, 574, 575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586]. [cite_start]An ultrasonic sensor displays real-time distance on the LCD and streams it to the Bluetooth module[cite: 478, 479].
    * [cite_start]**Maze Mode (2)**: The robot autonomously navigates a maze using a left-hand rule algorithm[cite: 432]. [cite_start]It utilizes a servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor to scan its surroundings and avoid obstacles[cite: 410, 434, 435].
    * [cite_start]**Testing Mode (3)**: A built-in diagnostic mode that sequentially tests the motors and servo to ensure all components are functioning correctly[cite: 436, 437].
    * [cite_start]**VC Mode (A)**: A dedicated mode for custom or future functionality[cite: 465, 466].
* [cite_start]**Intuitive User Interface**: The robot's status and menu are displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD[cite: 413, 499, 500, 507, 508]. [cite_start]A 7-segment display provides clear visual feedback for mode selection and status[cite: 411, 471, 472, 473].
* [cite_start]**Safety Features**: A global emergency stop function is available via a dedicated keypad button (`D`) and a Bluetooth command (`X`)[cite: 450, 451, 452, 453, 585, 586]. [cite_start]This feature immediately halts all motors and provides an audible and visual alert[cite: 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544].
* [cite_start]**Dynamic Visual Feedback**: A series of LEDs (Green, Red, Blue) provide a welcoming sequence and dynamic light patterns that respond to the robot's current mode and state[cite: 399, 446, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 527, 528, 529].

## üèÉ Usage

[cite_start]Upon startup, the robot will perform a brief welcome sequence[cite: 482]. [cite_start]The LCD will then display a menu[cite: 499]. Use the keypad to select a mode:
* Press **'1'** for **Bluetooth Mode**.
* Press **'2'** for **Maze Mode**.
* Press **'3'** for **Testing Mode**.
* Press **'A'** for **VC Mode**.

[cite_start]**Emergency Stop**: Press **'D'** on the keypad at any time to activate the emergency stop[cite: 450].
